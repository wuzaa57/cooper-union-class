This is just a sample project to get the students in a guest lecture at Cooper Union going with GitHub and Heroku

My project is to display frequently used words by having the words increase by a pixel for every 10 uses. This would be a graphical display for the user with the fun of knowing his or her most used words.

My project would be to display frequently used words by having a word appear after 10
uses, and then increase in font size by one pixel for every ten uses of the word. Up to a
certain font size, the code will be edited to allow the pixel increment for every fifty
uses of the word. This will provide a graphical image for entertainment purposes as the
user will see which words he or she uses frequently.
